ERC-520: Accretive Tokens 

ERC-520 introduces Accretive Tokens, an experimental and innovative asset class that combines ERC-721 NFTs with an ERC-20 valuation token. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely on speculation, Accretive Tokens accrue value over time through a structured appreciation model.
Each ERC-721 NFT represents a unique digital collectible, while the ERC-20 valuation token provides liquidity and measurable worth. This dual-token mechanism ensures that Accretive Tokens are not just collectibles but evolving financial assets, pioneering a new paradigm for NFTs with real, sustainable value growth.
 
How ERC-520 Works: The Experimental Dual-Token Model
1️ ERC-721 NFT (The Collectible Asset)
  •	Represents a unique, non-fungible Accretive Token with built-in scarcity.
  •	Minted under a tiered rarity system that determines initial value and appreciation potential.
  •	Can be held for long-term appreciation or liquidated into ERC-20 valuation tokens.
  
2️ ERC-20 Valuation Token (The Liquid Asset)
  •	Every Accretive Token has an intrinsic base value backed by an ERC-20 token.
  •	NFTs can be converted into valuation tokens through a liquidation mechanism.
  •	The ERC-20 token has a fixed supply of 21 million, ensuring deflationary tokenomics.
  
Together, these two elements form an experimental yet structured tokenomic system where NFTs grow in value and can be converted into liquid assets.

Key Features of ERC-520
A. Experimental Accretive Token Minting and Scarcity Tiers
  •	NFTs are minted under ERC-721, with a structured tiered scarcity model.
  •	Each tier affects the rarity, base value, and appreciation mechanics.
  •	Only 520 NFTs will ever be created, ensuring exclusivity.
  
B. Liquidity and Valuation Mechanism
  •	Holders can liquidate their NFTs into ERC-20 valuation tokens.
  •	Liquidation considers two core value components:
    1.	Base Value – The original assigned value of the NFT at minting.
    2.	Appreciation Value – The accrued increase in value over time, following a predefined model.
    
C. Appreciation & Deflationary Tokenomics
  •	Accretive Tokens increase in value over time, with an appreciation period of up to 72 years.
  •	The total supply of the ERC-20 valuation token is capped at 21 million, enforcing deflationary tokenomics.
  •	The scarcity of both NFTs and valuation tokens ensures a sustainable ecosystem.
  
D. Creator Rewards System
  •	Every liquidation event rewards the original creator, ensuring ongoing incentives.
  •	A portion of the liquidation value is distributed to creators, maintaining a balanced ecosystem.
  •	This model encourages long-term engagement and innovation.

E. Creator Incentive Program
  •	Go-Live Reward: Upon launch, creators receive 40,000 valuation tokens as an initial incentive.
  •	Monthly Creator Reward: For the first 12 months, creators earn 40,000 valuation tokens per month to support ecosystem development.

Conclusion
ERC-520 is an experimental framework for next-generation NFTs, combining the scarcity of ERC-721 with the liquidity of ERC-20. Accretive Tokens are not just static collectibles—they are dynamic assets that evolve and accumulate value over time.
With built-in appreciation, a deflationary economic model, and creator incentives, Accretive Tokens are designed for long-term holders, investors, and innovators.
This isn’t just another NFT—it’s an experiment in digital ownership that appreciates, strengthens, and holds real value over time.
