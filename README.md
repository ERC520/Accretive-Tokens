# ERC-520: Accretive Tokens 💎 💎 💎 💎 💎

ERC-520 introduces **Accretive Tokens**, an **experimental and innovative asset class** that combines **ERC-721 NFTs with an ERC-20 valuation token**. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely on speculation, Accretive Tokens **accrue value over time** through a structured appreciation model.  

Each ERC-721 NFT represents a unique digital collectible, while the ERC-20 valuation token provides **liquidity and measurable worth**. This dual-token mechanism ensures that **Accretive Tokens are not just collectibles but evolving financial assets**, pioneering a **new paradigm for NFTs with real, sustainable value growth**.  

## 🚀 How ERC-520 Works:

### 1️⃣ ERC-721 NFT (The Collectible Asset)  
- Represents a **unique, non-fungible Accretive Token** with built-in scarcity.  
- Minted under a **tiered rarity system** that determines **initial value and appreciation potential**.  
- Can be **held for long-term appreciation or liquidated** into ERC-20 valuation tokens.  

### 2️⃣ ERC-20 Valuation Token (The Liquid Asset)  
- Every Accretive Token has an **intrinsic base value** backed by an ERC-20 token.  
- NFTs can be **converted into valuation tokens** through a liquidation mechanism.  
- The ERC-20 token has a **fixed supply of 21 million**, ensuring **deflationary tokenomics**.  

Together, these two elements form an **experimental yet structured tokenomic system** where **NFTs grow in value and can be converted into liquid assets**.

## 🔑 Key Features of ERC-520  

### A. Experimental Accretive Token Minting and Scarcity Tiers  
- NFTs are minted under **ERC-721**, with a structured **tiered scarcity model**.  
- Each tier affects the **rarity, base value, and appreciation mechanics**.  
- Only **520 NFTs** will ever be created, ensuring exclusivity.  

### B. Liquidity and Valuation Mechanism  
- Holders can **liquidate** their NFTs into ERC-20 valuation tokens.  
- Liquidation considers two core value components:  
  1. **Base Value** – The original assigned value of the NFT at minting.  
  2. **Appreciation Value** – The accrued increase in value over time, following a predefined model.  

### C. Appreciation & Deflationary Tokenomics  
- Accretive Tokens **increase in value over time**, with an appreciation period of up to **72 years**.  
- The **total supply of the ERC-20 valuation token is capped at 21 million**, enforcing deflationary tokenomics.  
- The **scarcity of both NFTs and valuation tokens** ensures a sustainable ecosystem.

### D. Creator Rewards System  
- **Every liquidation event rewards the original creator**, ensuring ongoing incentives.  
- A **portion of the liquidation value** is distributed to creators, maintaining a balanced ecosystem.  
- This model **encourages long-term engagement and innovation**.  

### E. Creator Incentive Program  
- **Go-Live Reward:** Upon launch, creators receive **40,000 valuation tokens** as an initial incentive.  
- **Monthly Creator Reward:** For the first **12 months**, creators earn **40,000 valuation tokens per month** to support ecosystem development.
